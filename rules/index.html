            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>We are the Taiwan Returnee Club (TRC) Discord server and are thrilled to have you here! But before joining us, please read the our rules so that we are all on the same page on how to act nicely to make this community a wholesome and vibrant one.</p><br />
            <p>For starters, we are NOT a political server, thus, please keep such debates to a minimum or send them in the <b>#辯論┊debate</b> channel. Failure to comply resulting in server conflicts or drama will subject you to being warned, muted or even banned. Thank you for your understanding!</p>
            <br /><br />
            <h1>Server Rules</h1>
            <ol>

            <br /><br />
            <h1>How we Moderate</h1>
            <p>This is our general process in handling members who break server rules. Please note that verbal reminder, warning, and notice are synonymous in this server. They mean the same thing. A verbal reminder is ANY reminder given to you verbally by the staff which may be in the server or in DMs (direct messages).</p><br />
            <ol>
                <li><b style="color:#8CFB4C">@First Strike</b>, <b style="color:#ECFD53">@Second Strike</b> and <b style="color:#F5C041">@Last Strike</b>: nothing happens, you just get pinged and verbally reminded.</li>
                <li><b style="color:#EC722E">@First Warning</b>: your account will be muted for 1 day.</li>
                <li><b style="color:#E93C24">@Second Warning</b>: your account will be muted for 2 days, you cannot change nicknames for 14 days, and 14 days ban from entering any voice chats (VCs) in the server.</li>
                <li><b style="color:#A62116">@Last Warning</b>: you are muted for 7 days, will not able to change nicknames, and are banned from all voice chats in the server.</li>
                <li>Finally, we ban members who violates our rules again after <b style="color:#A62116">@Last Warning</b>.</li>
            </ol><br />
            <p>Notice how we all start out as green in the <b style="color:#75FB83">@Norm</b> after verification. This means you have no infractions recorded in this server. As you get closer to getting banned, your color changes to yellow and then shifts to dangerous red right before your ban.</p><br />
            <p>Respect all staff decisions. Calmly discuss with a staff member if you think there's been a mistake. If you throw a tantrum, your strike will quickly progress to a ban. Please do not throw a tantrum as all bans are final.</p>
            <br /><br />
